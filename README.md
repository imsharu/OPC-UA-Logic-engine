# OPC-UA-Logic-engine
Below is an example README.md file suitable for a GitHub repository containing the four files:

app_6.py
templates/index_6.html
static/style_6.css
static/script_6.js
The README explains what the project does, how to install and run it, and provides an overview of the functionalities.

OPC-UA & Logic Engine
A Flask-based application that displays an OPC-UA server structure, allows drag-and-drop creation of logical and mathematical operation boxes on a canvas, and supports chaining outputs via lines for a simple node-graph style interface.

Features
OPC-UA Hierarchy

Retrieves and displays OPC-UA nodes, groups, and tags in a nested, collapsible list.
Tags are draggable onto operation boxes.
Logical/Math Operations

Drag & drop “AND,” “OR,” “NOT,” “ADD,” “SUBTRACT,” etc. onto a canvas to create operation boxes.
Each box has input slots (?) for tags or chained outputs from other boxes.
Displays each box’s Output value automatically.
Line Connections

Draw lines from an operation box’s output handle to another box’s input, creating a chained flow of values.
Auto-Evaluation

Whenever a tag is dropped or a connection is formed, all boxes re-calculate their outputs.
Infinity and NaN are prevented or handled by default logic (can be customized).
Separation of Concerns

app_6.py: Flask server, OPC-UA fetch logic, evaluation endpoints (optional).
index_6.html: Main HTML with canvas containers.
style_6.css: Layout, styling, collapsible lists, operation box design.
script_6.js: Front-end logic, drag & drop, line drawing, box evaluation.

app_6.py
Flask app providing routes to fetch the OPC-UA structure, serve the HTML, and optionally evaluate tag values or logic/math ops.

templates/index_6.html
The main page structure. Contains a side panel for draggable items and a canvas-container for the logic canvas.

static/style_6.css
Handles layout, collapsible lists, and styling of the operation boxes.

static/script_6.js
Front-end logic for drag & drop, creating boxes, line drawing, and re-evaluation of chained operations.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ (or any recent Python 3.x version).
pip for installing Python packages.
OPC-UA server (if you want to connect to a real server) or no server if you only want to see the structure code’s default behavior.
Node or npm are not required; the client logic is pure JavaScript.
Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/opcua-logic-engine.git
cd opcua-logic-engine
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install flask opcua
Flask: for the web server.
opcua: for connecting to an OPC-UA server.
Usage
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app_6.py
By default, it starts at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Open a web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

The left panel shows Logical Operations, Mathematical Operations, and the OPC-UA structure (if connected).
The right side has two stacked canvases and any operation boxes you create.
Drag an operator (e.g., “ADD”) from the left panel onto the canvas. A new “operation box” appears.

Drag a tag from the OPC-UA structure onto any “?” input in the operation box.

Click and drag from the box’s output handle (the small circle on the right side) to another box’s input to chain the outputs.

Observe the “Output:” label in each box updating whenever inputs or connections change.

How It Works
OPC-UA Structure
The app calls /api/get-opcua-structure, which:

Connects to opc.tcp://127.0.0.1:49320 (configurable in fetch_structure).
Recursively walks the OPC-UA server’s Objects node.
Builds a nested JSON ({ channelName: { _tags: {...}, _groups: {...} } }) describing the hierarchy.
Returns it as JSON for the front-end.
In the front-end, script_6.js populates the #opc-structure list, making each tag draggable.

Logical and Math Operations
Lists like “AND”, “OR”, “NOT”, “ADD”, “SUBTRACT”, etc. are shown in collapsible sections in the left sidebar.
Dragging them onto the canvas creates a box with a fixed number of inputs:
2 inputs by default,
8 for math ops (like “ADD” or “DIVIDE”),
1 for “NOT,” etc.
Canvas and Line Drawing
#logicCanvas: A background canvas. The user drops items here.
#linesCanvas: A transparent overlay. We draw connections on it using requestAnimationFrame or quick redrawing after each event.
Each “operation box” is an HTML <div> (absolutely positioned), which has:
“Output: ?” label (updated whenever the box re-evaluates).
A small handle on the right edge to start drawing lines.
Evaluation Flow
When an input changes (tag dropped, line connected), we call:
recalcAllBoxes(): Loops through each box and calls evaluateBox(box).
evaluateBox(box): Sums, multiplies, or performs logical operations based on the box’s inputs (which might be tags or other boxes’ outputs).
drawAllConnections(): Clears #linesCanvas and redraws all lines.
This ensures the entire network of boxes is always up to date.

Customization
OPC-UA Endpoint: Change the URL in app_6.py inside fetch_structure("opc.tcp://127.0.0.1:49320") to match your actual server address.
Tag Value Handling:
Currently, tags default to 0 for math boxes and false for logical boxes. To read real-time values, modify evaluateBox() to call /api/get-tag-value or maintain an OPC-UA subscription.
NaN / Infinity Handling:
In the “DIVIDE” operation, if denominator = 0, we set result to Infinity. You can change it to 0 or show an error.
For “MULTIPLY,” if an input is invalid, the result can become NaN. Again, see the code comments for how to override that.
